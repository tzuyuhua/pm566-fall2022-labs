```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r install-libraries}
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
```


## Step 1. Read in the data
First download and then read in with read.csv()

```{r read-data, cache=TRUE}
if (!file.exists("mtsamples.csv")){
  download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv",
                "mtsamples.csv", method="libcurl", timeout = 60)
}

mts <- read.csv("mtsamples.csv")
str(mts)
mts <- as_tibble(mts)
mts
```

# Question 1: What specialties do we have?
We can use count() from dplyr to figure out how many records are there per speciality.

```{r medical-specialties}
specialties <- 
  mts %>%
  count(medical_specialty)

specialties %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

These are `r nrow(specialties)` medical specialties.

```{r barplot-of-specialty-counts}
specialties %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = n, y= fct_reorder(medical_specialty, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

The distribution is not at all uniform.

# Question 2
Tokenize the the words in the transcription column
Count the number of times each token appears
Visualize the top 20 most frequent words
Explain what we see from this result. Does it makes sense? What insights (if any) do we get?

```{r token-transcription, cache = TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(token, transcription) %>%
  count(token, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(token, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

There are a lot of stopwords here, non-specific to medical text. We do see "patient", phew!

## Question 3. Redo analysis in Q2, and remove stopwords.
Redo visualization but remove stopwords before
Bonus points if you remove numbers as well

```{r, cache=TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  # use regular expression to filter out numbers
  filter( !grepl(pattern = "^[0-9]+$", x = word )) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```


Removing the stopwords and nubmers gives us a much better idea of what the text is about.

## Question 4
repeat question 2, but this time tokenize into bi-grams. 

```{r biograms-transcription, cache=TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  #anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(bigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r trigrams-transcription, cache=TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(trigram, transcription, n=3) %>%
  count(trigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  #anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(trigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

Top 20 trigrams seemed to return a few more medical word group than bigrams.

## Question 5
Using the results you got from questions 4. Pick a word and count the words that appears after and before it.

```{r bigrams-transcription-nextword, cache=TRUE}
ptbigram <- mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  select(word1, word2) %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient" | word2 == "patient")
```


Words appear before patient:

```{r before-patient}
ptbigram %>% 
  filter(word2 == "patient") %>%
  count(word1, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word1" = "word")) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

Find the words following patient:

```{r after-patient}
ptbigram %>% 
  filter(word1 == "patient") %>%
  count(word2, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word2" = "word")) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

## Question 6
Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use group_by() and top_n() from dplyr to have the calculations be done within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most 5 used words?
